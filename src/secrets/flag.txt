🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! 🎉
======================

You successfully exploited the path traversal vulnerability!

FLAG: PTH_TRAV_2024_SUCCESS_FLAG_{you_found_me}

This file was located at: ../secrets/flag.txt

Path traversal (also known as directory traversal) allows attackers
to access files and directories outside the intended web root directory.

Remember:
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use whitelists instead of blacklists
- Implement proper access controls
- Use realpath() and verify paths stay within allowed directories

Keep learning and stay ethical! 🔐
